    bio: "Ben loves using Python every day in his work as a data scientist
       to help organisations get more from their data. For his recently
       completed PhD thesis in collaboration with Fisher & Paykel Appliances,
       Ben developed machine learning algorithms in Python that can be applied
       despite common data deficiencies. Ben's experience ranges from data
       science to web application development, and he previously worked as
       software architect for NZ security software startup DataMasque. Ben
       loves teaching others how to get stuff done with Python; he has
       run training courses on a variety of technologies for
       software development and co-delivered talks and an 'unconference' with
       Grant Paton-Simpson at the national Python conference: KiwiPycon."
