**Learn Python programming with individual support in a friendly
learning environment**

The NZ Python User Group is running a community training initiative in
the Auckland CBD. There is no cost and the course is being run by
experienced volunteers.

The goal is to up-skill people in the worldâ€™s most popular programming
language. Python is used for automation, data science, web
development, and much more.

It is very common for training needs to get pushed aside by the
demands of work and the friendly and supportive learning environment
provided in the course helps people actually learn enough to start
putting Python to work.

* **When:** Mondays 11:30am - 1:30pm
* **Where:** 136 Fanshawe Street, Auckland CBD
* **Duration:** 10 weeks
* **Cost:** Free (community initiative)
* **Note:** BYO lunch and laptop (food outlets in building and guest
  WiFi)

## Learning objectives

1. Learn the fundamentals of the Python language
2. Learn to use Python to analyse and plot tabular data (e.g.
   spreadsheets)
3. Be supported in learning to apply Python to your own areas of
   interest

## Course Content

The initial weeks of the course will be taught based on the following
online course materials:

* [Plotting and Programming in Python by Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/)
* [Futurecoder tutorials on Python fundamentals](https://futurecoder.io/)

The latter weeks of the course will shift towards independent project
work according to your interests.

You will be encouraged to bring along your own coding / work problems.
